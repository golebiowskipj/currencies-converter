## Disclaimer 

This is just a showcase of good practices, design patterns and implementation ideas - totally not relateble for a project size :) 

Libraries like translations, ui-kit or even using typescript would never be used for this solution. 

At the same time, I didn't want to put much effort in things like pixel perfect icons (flags etc.) or whole country codes list so I just used simplies possible solution.
